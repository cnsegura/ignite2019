# Hands on Lab: Highspeed Blockchain

In this lab you will use the VS Code extension for blockchain development (already pre-installed on your lab VM) to download a popular open-source smart contract (in this case an ERC-20 token contract from OpenZeppelin), build and deploy that contract to your local machine and to the Azure Blockchain Service.

After deploying and interacting with this token locally, lab attendees will then use the VS Code extension to easily create a set of microservices, based on Azure Logic Apps, for the token and then integrate this series of Logic Apps into Azure. 

Once the Logic Apps are deployed, lab attendees will then exercise a smart contract function, for the contract deployed to Azure Blockchain Service - this is a Enterprise typical workflow of using a REST like interface to interact with a smart contract on the ledger.

This lab is broken down into 4 stories/phases. If at any time the lab attendee falls behind, or cannot complete a section, there is a fast forward option with a completed example on the VMs local drive for the attendee to leverage and move forward.
